<Program> Self budgeting App
	The user enters the name of their budget and adds portions with which the budget will be divided into.
	The sections are divided into two:
		over total and over remainder
	Over total is the amount of money that will be subtracted from the original amount
	Over remainder is the amount of money that will be subtracted from the remaining amount after the one over total has been subtracted.
		(Calculatd same as for total but with the remaining amount after total)
The extra remainder if amount modded by 10 is reallocated by self will to whichever section one desires

Program was created to remove the use of pen and calculator from my daily budget and creating a sense of money responsibility with every coin budgeted and with a purpose.
		##<USAGE>
use the letter `q` to get out of any persistent prompt
